# Vault
Vault is my very own FoundryVTT module containing items, macros, and other small things that help me DM my games.

It's also just an excuse for me to learn more about Foundry's extensive module system. I hope you find something useful in this collection of mine!

It includes:
* Sci-Fi, Anime, and Video Game inspired items, including iconic weapons like Lightsabers or the Dark Moon Greatsword
* Growth-based weapons for the main characters inside us
* Helpful macros to improveâ„¢ the DM experience

## Supported Systems

* pf2e
